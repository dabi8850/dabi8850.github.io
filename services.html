                            Are you looking for that get lean program? If you are then this is it. The following is a lean out program for lifters who are stuck in a rut or who are just looking for a change! The reps are not too high because you need to focus on strength and earning or keeping the muscle you do have.
                            You will not get huge off of this program because the meal plan is not too high in complex carbohydrates and there is only enough protein to be consumed for a slight gain in muscle, but mostly a maintenance amount to help you keep what you already have. The idea behind this program is to eat clean, workout mean, and get lean.
                            After about the first week you will notice your body taking shape already. Weeks two and three will be wonderful for the person who really sticks with the program.

                    <p>At Let The Gains Begin, we believe that fitness is a life long practice that everyone should partake in. <br>

                              What, you ponder, do you have in common with bodybuilding greats like Arnold Schwarzenegger or Jay Cutler, or even with a successful fitness model like Whitney Reid?
                             
                              Each of those men, like you, had modest beginnings. None was born with six-pack abs and none came into this world with a 250-pound bench press. But like you, they had a desire for self-improvement and undertook resistance training as a means to build up their physique.
                            
                              All of these men committed serious mistakes along the way, and we're here to make sure that you, as a beginner, can learn from others' errors. <br> <br>To get you started off right, we've put together an eight-week full-body beginner's program that's built to challenge you as you get stronger.
                            
                              After that break-in period, you'll have one more thing in common with those superstars: None of you will be a rank beginner any longer.
